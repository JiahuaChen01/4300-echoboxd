Driven by a pitch-perfect cast and the confident directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, \"Inception\" is a brilliant and unrivaled piece of filmmaking.",

The kind of movie so quickly endearing to me that I texted people to talk about it/recommend it only 20 minutes in. Everyone's so good in it (RuPaul! Holy shit!) and there are so many surprisingly tender and sweet little things that go almost underacknowledged, despite being the basis for entire seasons of TV shows that try to exist as Queer Life 101 for straights. Magnificent. Luv u Jamie Babbit. :)",
